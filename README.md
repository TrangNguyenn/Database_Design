# Airbnb_Database_Design
A real-world database design and implementation project. Based on the Airbnb app and website, I designed and developed relational databases by using SQL and a database management system ORACLE. 

Run the script from the your Oracle prompt by running the command “@<filename.sql>”.

For example:

SQL> @schema.sql

This command will create tables.

SQL> @data.sql

This command will insert data in the tables
